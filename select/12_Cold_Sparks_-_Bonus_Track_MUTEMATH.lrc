[00:09.55] By the silent lake in us
[00:13.16] Take a another walk on ice tonight
[00:30.16] 
[00:27.70] We are when we find cold sparks
[00:35.98] And only time can show us all that it cost
[00:46.73] Well the fire got lost, cold sparks
[01:04.23] 
[00:56.80] Feelings, hours, ahead of us
[01:07.67] Just our shadows and happy us, oh us

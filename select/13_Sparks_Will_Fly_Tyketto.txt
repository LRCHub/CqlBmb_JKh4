It's got to rain sometimes
It's got to pour right down upon everything
It's got to rain sometimes
To beat down the dust we're living in
The just and the unjust
All get soaked to the skin
It's got to rain sometimes

It's got to hurt sometimes
If you're gonna wake up to the truth you've seen
It's got to burn sometimes
No one wants a story that tells too clean
Will you sleep through your moment
When the powers convene
It's got to hurt sometimes

When you're halfway there with no way back
The only defense is to get on the attack

Sparks will fly
Nothing comes unless you try to find
A way to go another round
And we all fall down
Brace yourselves here comes the ground you might
Find shelter when the rain comes down

You've got to break sometimes
Everybody needs a good collapse
You must forsake sometimes
All the little things that hold you back
You got to shatter and splinter
And shudder and roll
Learn how to howl with your stereo
To keep testing for echo
You got to climb down in this hole
You got to break sometimes

When that wake up call comes in for you
The only answer is to bullet straight on through

Sparks will fly
Catch a flame and make it burn out bright
Shadows cannot stand the light
And we all fall down
Make your peace and stand your ground tonight
Tell 'em all "Come out and fight"

Sparks will fly
Hold your own and keep your powder dry
Take the fight to higher ground
And we all fall down
Brace yoursleves it's coming round tonight
So let the god damned rain fall down
Let it fall on down

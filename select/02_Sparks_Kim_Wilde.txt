Caught in the times we live in
Caught in the times we know
It's taking a real hard line
You feel you're becoming a number
Nobody needs your trouble
Gives you the time of day
But kicking the world behind
Won't make it go away
'Cause we're strong
And we're big enough to take
Whatever time will bring
We've only one life
And we've gotta lot to give
There's only one time
And we've got to make or break it

Let the Sparks fly out again
Let the feelings tell you when
Let the Sparks fly out again

Flick of the fingers
And they'll cut you down for sure
You gotta be hard sometimes
And so you pretend it's nothing
Finding what to believe in
That's what it's hard to do
Boy there was another time
I saw the best in you
'Cause we're strong
And we're big enough to take
Whatever time will bring

[00:16.70] The way you move is like a full on rainstorm, and I'm a house of cards
[00:24.37] You're the kind of reckless that should send me running, but I kinda know that I won't get far
[00:33.35] And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
[00:41.45] Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of
[01:11.45] 
[00:48.31] Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
[00:53.96] Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
[00:58.11] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[01:05.68] Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
[01:10.76] Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
[01:14.98] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[01:35.98] 
[01:31.85] My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
[01:39.79] You touch me once and it's really something
[01:44.53] You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
[01:48.76] I'm on my guard for the rest of the world, but with you, I know it's no good
[01:56.76] And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would
[02:24.26] 
[02:03.52] Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
[02:09.35] Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
[02:13.45] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[02:21.04] Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
[02:26.29] Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
[02:30.65] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[02:51.65] 
[02:47.09] I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
[02:55.03] Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
[03:03.75] And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
[03:11.58] I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show
[03:36.08] 
[03:18.55] Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
[03:24.73] Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
[03:28.74] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[03:36.28] Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
[03:41.35] Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
[03:45.16] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[04:06.16] 
[03:57.27] And the sparks fly
[04:00.92] Oh, baby, smile
[04:06.32] And the sparks fly

Cold wind carry me home again
Away from you
Withe skin remind me of winter
Crystal clear

Is it sharp, is it dark
Do your eyes see sparks?

In the last few days we ended all the mysteries
Whether we were meant to be
Oh how I like the way you brought me in your history
Oh my?

Sometimes I can hear the things that's said of me
When I'm not around
And then I find my self wondering
If you could hear what I said back to you

All this hands consider them found
Follow the end of sky to the ground
From the heart of the stone to the swirls in the clouds
Leave me there...

In the last few days we've ended all the mystery
Whether we were meant to be
Oh how I like the way you brought me in your history
Oh my?

Sometimes I can hear the things that's said of me
When I'm not around
And then I find my self wondering
If you could hear what I said back to you last time

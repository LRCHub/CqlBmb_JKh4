Lying down on the floor
Late night and
you don't know, don't know
Don't know what to do-o
Hard to tell what's wrong,
what's right
If yes or no, don't know
Don't know what to do-o
The storm hits hard and
you're losing the way
Just take a chance and
dance in the rain
'Cuz you got the key,
never throw it away
Don't forget,
don't forget what I said
Get out of your head!
Life is only what you make it
You're gonna be okay
So go ahead and do it, do it
If you want it let's get to it!
Everybody's gonna know your name
Cuz sparks light the flame
Turn the dark
of the night into day
(Don't stop, don't stop
Just go your own way!!)
So don't be afraid
Trust your heart,
keep your head in the game
(Keep up, keep up
And never be afraid!!)
Gotta make it hot like a volcano
Strike a match and burn it up
Kick your feet against the table
To the beat of your own drum
Sparks light the flame,
so don't wait
Start a fire today
(Don't stop, don't stop
Just go your own way!!)
We ain't looking back
Take the fast lane now
In the driver's seat strapped
They just gasp out loud
We're going so fast
that it shouldn't be allowed
That's how we like it
You heard what I said
Get out of your head!
Life is only what you make it
You're gonna be okay (yeah)
So take a step and
move it, move it
'Less you try
you won't get through it
Everybody's gonna know
your name!!!
Cuz sparks light the flame
Turn the dark
of the night into day
(Don't stop, don't stop
Just go your own way!!)
So don't be afraid
Trust your heart,
keep your head in the game
(Keep up, keep up
And never be afraid!!)
Let go of the past tonight
Choose the future
only you define
Even when the flames
burn too bright, you're alive
From the ashes you rise
Cuz sparks light the flame
Turn the dark
of the night into day
(Don't stop, don't stop
Just go your own way!!)
So don't be afraid
Trust your heart,
keep your head in the game
(Keep up, keep up
And never be afraid!!)
Gotta make it hot like a volcano
Strike a match and burn it up
Kick your feet against the table
To the beat of your own drum
Sparks light the flame,
so don't wait
Start a fire today
(Don't stop, don't stop
Just go your own way!!)
(Ah yeah)
